# **Wax Crate Application Testing Document**
## **Testing approach**
As I was done with development reasonably quickly, I wanted to try where possible to adopt a hybrid approach to testing and do some automated testing and then resort to manual testing where I didn’t feel confident enough to write automated testing. As a result, I think that my application is pretty watertight from bugs.
## **Issues During the Development Process**
In all honesty, I didn’t come across too many issues in the development process. I had a couple of issues here and there which I will detail below:

1. in terms of URL patterns as one of my URLs takes a slug and some take integers and that was causing some pain until I moved the slug URL to the end of the pattern list. 
2. I also had a nightmare when my code stopped working randomly, turned out it was becuase I deleted my session before I added the functionality to remove items from the cart.

1. **Validation issues** – As I used Bootstraps HTML and customised it to suit my needs, straight after I finished the development, I validated my HTML. It was littered with errors at first where I hadn’t conformed to the w3 standards. The most pressing validation errors were due to divs inside button elements and duplicate IDs. All of which were resolved. 

## **Automated Testing**
I've written 67 automated tests across the entire application to test models, model methods, views and forms. I will provide links to the tests app by app below.



To run the tests if you clone this repository, you will need to go to the settings.py file and disable any production databases you have set up as you want to ensure you arent running tests on database with live data. You will want to be using the SQL lite database that comes with django. 

Once the local django database has been enabled, to run the tests, you should enter "python3 manage.py test" into the terminal. Provided all the code is functioning as it should, you should see 67 tests passed as demonstrated below:

## **Manual Testing**
Like I mentioned a moment ago, I have done some very extensive manual testing on my application on several devices. To do so, I created a checklist using Excel. You can access the completed checklist [here](). Just note you will need to download it to view it. In case you dont have excel, I have detailed each of the testing checklists in markdown tables below.

On submission of update qty, totals update correctly.<br><br>FUNCTIONAL BUG:<br>When multiple records are in the cart, the update button was not working for all records, only the last. This was due to the javascript recognisising the click event of this button.<br><br>FIX:<br>Tried using the prev() jquery method to look up the dom for the form related to each record but that didnt work. I suspect that its because of the grid layout I've used. Tried the prevAll method and that was also unsuccessful. Realised that I needed to make each class unique so rendered the record id at the end of each class name in the edit-qty-remove-form-{{ record.record\_id }}. Then used similar logic to the delete button by adding an id with the record ID in it, splitting that id within the javascript and then passing it to the form jquery selector in a template literal so that each form could be found based on its corresponding unique value.

In my manual testing, I've basically gone element by element testing the functionality to ensure it displays and functions as expected..





I came across a little problem when doing my performance testing in that the image quality on the logo was causing a less than desirable score on google lighthouse. I replaced the image with a higher resolution and added a height declaration to the image to resize it. This bumped the lighthouse score up so that all pages are sitting in the mid to high 90s for all metrics.

To summarise the manual testing, the website has been tested by myself in both portrait and landscape mode (where appliable) on the following devices, browsers & operating systems:

   * Google Pixel 3 – Google Chrome, MS Edge, Firefox – Android 12
   * iPad 6th Gen - Safari 14, Google Chrome, Firefox Daylight, MS Edge - iOS 14.4
   * HP Elitebook – Google Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge & Windows 10
   * AOC Desktop Monitor – Google Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge – Windows 10.  

On that basis, the application is responsive and functional across a multitude of browsers and devices.
## Known Issues
I have a few known issues/errors that I haven’t been able to shake. 
1. In the workspace, I have some linter errors. I keep getting various models has no "X" objects member. This is not a valid error. I’ve tried to # noqa these so that they don’t appear, but the code is fully PEP8 compliant. These errors are just GitPod being weird. I confirmed this with tutor support.
2. I have some intermittent console warnings coming from what I assume is Summernote in terms of non-scrolling violations.
3. I have some PEP8 validation issues within the settings.py file, this file comes directly from the Django framework and no PEP8 issues are being caused by the code I’ve added so I’m leaving them alone for fear of angering the framework.
4. I have a few very small visual bugs in sticky pseudo classes when the user presses an accordion header. They are really quite sparse, mainly when customers use touch devices and the pseudo selector on hover sticks when the user presses the back button on the browser. These are edge cases also.
5. Probably the biggest blunder I have made during the whole course. I named my directories when starting the project in camelCase rather than snake_case. I've tried to change these directory names but now that the application is fully developed, the names are weaved in to the fabric of the app including my database and all the sublayers of code. I changed the names and anywhere they were referenced in the files to the new directory names but it had an absolutley catastrophic effect on the application. I hard reset my code back to a previous commit and wiped the bad commits from the repository and everything is working again. This would be the first thing that I would fix if I was to do this project again.
# Performance Testing
To test the performance of the website, I used Google Lighthouse inside Chrome Dev Tools. Below I will outline the applications performance via the metrics provided by Google Lighthouse:
## **Sign in page**
![sign-in-lighthouse](readme-files/images/testing/1-alli-testing.png)
## **Home Page**
![home-page-lighthouse](readme-files/images/testing/2-alli-testing.png)
## **Add complaint page**
![add-complaint-lighthouse](readme-files/images/testing/3-alli-testing.png)
## **Edit complaint page**
![edit-complaint-lighthouse](readme-files/images/testing/4-alli-testing.png)
# **Code Validation**
All my code has been validated through official sources.
## **Python** 
All my custom python files have been validated through the [PEP8 online validator](http://pep8online.com/) with no errors or issues (the settings.py file has some line length errors but the strings where these errors occur are part of the framework).
## **HTML5**
All of my templates, once rendered in Heroku, have been validated through the [W3 Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate-by-input) via direct input. No errors or warning on any of the pages.
## **CSS3**
My custom CSS file has been validated using the [W3 Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) via direct input. No errors or warnings present. 
## **JavaScript**
My custom JavaScript code has been validated through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). No errors present.
